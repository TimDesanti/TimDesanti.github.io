Using a temperature sensor, the system detects heat variations and actuates a small 12 V DC motor, controlled through an H-bridge driver, to open or close the slats of the blinds. The goal is to maintain thermal balance by minimizing excessive sunlight during hot conditions and maximizing natural warmth during cooler periods.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#project-summary","title":"Project Summary","text":"<p>The motor control subsystem operates a small 12 V DC brushed motor through an H-Bridge driver (FAN8100N) to open and close the blinds. Controlled by the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, it uses PWM signals to regulate motor speed and direction for smooth movement. A 9\u201312 V DC power source supplies the system, with voltage regulated to 5 V for control electronics. The design includes a status LED and connector interface for integration with the temperature sensing and main control modules.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My part of the project focuses on designing and constructing the motor control subsystem that physically opens and closes the blinds based on input from the main control unit.

It shows how power, sensing, and actuation are distributed throughout the system. A 12V 3A unregulated power supply provides the main power, which is regulated to 12V (1.5A) for the microcontroller and control electronics. An analog sensor connected to the ADC input (RA0) provides input signals for feedback or control. The H-Bridge (FAN8100N) drives the motor (actuator) using PWM signals from the microcontroller. Green LED to check if power is going through the system. It translates to a motor that will open and close the blinds depending on the signals given from the other components.</p>"},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#motor-pcb-block-diagram","title":"Motor PCB Block Diagram","text":"<p>Individual Block EGR304 TND (1).drawio </p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Tim Desanti 105","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#dc-motor","title":"DC Motor","text":"<ol> <li>GEARMOTOR 35 RPM 12V MIRCO METAL</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$37.95/each  </li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 12v Expensive Small in size Might be too slow High torque Size may not be as compact as wanted <ol> <li>GEARMOTOR 200 RPM 3\u20136V DC</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$2.95/each  </li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Low voltage use More expensive Compact Weak Simple wiring Low RPM <ol> <li>SERVOMOTOR RC 4.8V</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$3.62/each  </li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Quick response time Requires programming Precise movement Moderately expensive Programmable to move to set positions Requires more voltage <p>Choice: Option 1 \u2014 GEARMOTOR 35 RPM 12V MICRO METAL</p> <p>Rationale: Requires fewer programs to be made.
