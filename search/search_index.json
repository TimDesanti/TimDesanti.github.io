Using a temperature sensor, the system detects heat variations and actuates a small 12 V DC motor, controlled through an H-bridge driver, to open or close the slats of the blinds. The goal is to maintain thermal balance by minimizing excessive sunlight during hot conditions and maximizing natural warmth during cooler periods.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#project-summary","title":"Project Summary","text":"<p>The motor control subsystem operates a small 12 V DC brushed motor through an H-Bridge driver (FAN8100N) to open and close the blinds. Controlled by the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, it uses PWM signals to regulate motor speed and direction for smooth movement. A 9\u201312 V DC power source supplies the system, with voltage regulated to 5 V for control electronics. The design includes a status LED and connector interface for integration with the temperature sensing and main control modules.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My part of the project focuses on designing and constructing the motor control subsystem that physically opens and closes the blinds based on input from the main control unit.

It shows how power, sensing, and actuation are distributed throughout the system. A 9V 3A unregulated power supply provides the main power, which is regulated to 5V (1.5A) for the microcontroller and control electronics. An analog sensor connected to the ADC input (RA0) provides input signals for feedback or control. The H-Bridge (FAN8100N) drives the motor (actuator) using PWM signals from the microcontroller. Green LED to check if power is going through the system. It translates to a motor that will open and close the blinds depending on the signals given from the other components.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#blind-slats-pcb-block-diagram","title":"Blind Slats PCB Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Tim Desanti 105","text":"<p>DC Motor</p> <ol> <li>GEARMOTOR 100 RPM 12V METAL</li> </ol> <p></p> <pre><code>* $11.90/each\n* [link to product](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/dfrobot/FIT0492-B/7087168?)\n\n| Pros                                      | Cons                                                           |\n| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| moderly expensive                         | meant for high torque                                          |\n| small in size                             | Might be too slow                                              |\n| meant for high torque                     | Size may not be as compact as wanted                           |\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>GEARMOTOR 200 RPM 3-6V DC</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Low voltage use More expensive Compact Weak Simple wiring Low RPM </li> <li> <p>SERVOMOTOR RC 4.8V</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <pre><code>* $3.62/each\n* [link to product](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/dfrobot/SER0006/7597224)\n\n| Pros                                      | Cons                                                           |\n| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| quick response time                       | Have to create a program                                       |\n| percise movement                          | moderately expensive                                           |\n| programmable to move to certain positions | requires more voltage\n</code></pre> <p>Choice: Option 1: GEARMOTOR 100 RPM 12V METAL</p> <p>Rationale: Requires fewer programs to be made.
