title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
Calculated the voltage it would need and produced based on the components I've chosen for the project. Gave a voltage budget of how much current I would need and have left over when choosing a power supply.

## Conclusions

From the prepared Power Budget, we would need a high-voltage source or a high-voltage power rail to allow the parts to function properly. The budget is mostly budget-friendly voltage-wise, besides the 12V regulator that will consume more electricity. I believe using a wall adapter will solve this problem, other than using a battery to increase its duration, and using an external battery as a backup source if the power shuts down in the home.
