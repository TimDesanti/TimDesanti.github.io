title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
Calculated the voltage and current usage for the chosen components. Gave a voltage budget of how much current the components would need and show the remaining current when choosing a power supply. The chosen components were the PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller, GEAR MOTOR 12V 34RPM, and a IC REG LINEAR 5V 1.5A TO220 voltage regulator.

## Conclusions

From the prepared Power Budget, we would need a 12V power source and a 12V power rail to allow the parts to function properly. The budget is mostly budget-friendly voltage-wise, besides the 12V regulator and motor that will consume more electricity. I believe using a wall adapter will solve this problem.
