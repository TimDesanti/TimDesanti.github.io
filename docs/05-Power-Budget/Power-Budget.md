title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
Calculated the voltage and current usage for the chosen compenents. Gave a voltage budget of how much current the components would need and show the remaining current when choosing a power supply.

## Conclusions

From the prepared Power Budget, we would need a 12V power source or a 12V power rail to allow the parts to function properly. The budget is mostly budget-friendly voltage-wise, besides the 12V regulator that will consume more electricity. I believe using a wall adapter will solve this problem, other than using a battery to increase its duration, and using an external battery as a backup source if the power shuts down in the home.
