title: PCB Design
---

## Overview
This PCB design includes all components from the schematic. The motor will have male-male header pins sonnected to female-male jumper cables to allow a custom length from the board to its final location. Additionally, the microcontroller footprint will also have male-male headers, as it was already constructed due to breadboarding, its will be attached to the PCB with female-male headers to allow easy disconnection.
