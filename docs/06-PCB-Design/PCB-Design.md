title: PCB Design
---

## Overview
This PCB design contains all the components from the schematic design. The motor will have female header pins to allow a custom length from the board to wherever it needs to be placed. Additionally, the microcontroller footprint will also have female headers, as it was already constructed due to breadboarding.
